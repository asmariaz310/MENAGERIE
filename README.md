# MENAGERIE â€” A Tile-Matching Animal Puzzle Game

**MENAGERIE** is a colorful and engaging tile-matching puzzle game developed using **C++** and **SFML**, inspired by classics like *Bejeweled* and *Candy Crush*. 
Your goal? Match animal tiles, fill species repositories, and climb through exciting levels with strategic swaps and quick thinking.


## Game Objective

- Match 3 or more animals of the same species in a line to clear them from the board.
- Chains cause tiles to fall and refill the board.
- Track how many of each species you've collected.
- Progress to the next level by completing species-specific goals or maintaining a full progress bar under time pressure.


## Key Features

### Game Modes
- **Normal Mode:** Progress through levels by filling species-specific progress bars using chains. More points per chain as levels increase.
- **Time Trial Mode:** A more challenging mode where the progress bar depletes unless you continuously match tiles.

### Gameplay Mechanics
- **Grid-Based Matching:** Match only in horizontal or vertical lines. Diagonal matches are not allowed.
- **Tile Swapping:** Click on two adjacent animals to swap them.
- **Auto-Fill:** After clearing a chain, tiles fall to fill in the gaps, and new animals drop from above.

### Scoring
- Chains of 3 = base points
- Chains of 4 = bonus (x4)
- Chains of 5 = mega bonus (x5)
- Combo chains (formed in a single move) receive additional bonus points.

### Progress Tracking
- Real-time progress bars track each species collected.
- Scores and moves remaining are displayed.
- Time limit bar is visible during timed levels.
